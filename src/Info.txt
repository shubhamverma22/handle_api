In this Project I've created a very basic Card which whenever we refresh it it loads up
random information about Person their name,email,Phone No and even Photos.

By this Project you're gonna understand how API's are tackle down , how read JSON files
We're also understand how we can make a web request and GET some data from it

API used:- https://randomuser.me

For Handling the API we used package called axios, it supports Promises, it has asynchronous feature
sp it can do all of his job asynchronously means jobs are handling in the background and your application can load in the Frontend
which makes your application faster

By axios we can handle any request like GET,POST, PUT or DELETE; axios.get(),axios.post() and so on


Q. where you gonna store data?
Ans In states

Q. what you gonna set default value in useState?
Ans. As we know all we know is comes up in a JSON fromat so the default datatype of this is Object.
Object consist of variety of data. 


In usual cases if i'm doing a Production Grid application i'll move forward only if i'm get Status:200


*Note:- if in API's object we have multiple options than we ? to fetch them. see src line in MyCard.js file
